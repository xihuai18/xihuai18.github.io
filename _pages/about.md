I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [APEX Lab](https://apex.sjtu.edu.cn/) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, under the supervision of [Prof. Weinan Zhang](https://wnzhang.net/) and [Prof. Ying Wen](https://yingwen.io/). I am affiliated with both the SJTU-Apex Group and the SJTU-MARL Group led by Prof. Ying Wen. I was honored to be selected into the [Wen-Tsun Wu AI Honorary Doctoral Program](https://ai.sjtu.edu.cn/cultivate/postgraduate/managements) in 2020. Prior to this, I received my B.Eng. in Computer Science and Technology from the [School of Computer Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University](https://cse.sysu.edu.cn/) in 2020.

My research lies at the intersection of **Reinforcement Learning** and **Multi-Agent Learning**. My current research focuses on:

- **Large Language Model Reasoning and Agency**
  - Reinforcement learning methodologies for enhancing reasoning and agentic capabilities of LLMs
  - Human-AI collaborative decision-making with LLM-based agents
- **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning**
  - Sample-efficient algorithms for cooperative MARL
  - Zero-shot coordination and generalization in multi-agent systems
