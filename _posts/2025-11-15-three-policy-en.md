## Training–Inference Mismatch and Asynchronous Frameworks

Recently I’ve seen quite a lot of discussion around *training–inference mismatch* and *asynchronous RL frameworks* for large language models. My intuition is that many of these seemingly diverse and messy issues are, in fact, manifestations of a more fundamental tension: a mismatch between the **behavior policy** and the **reference policy**.

In this post, I’ll first briefly summarize the related work I’ve come across, and then try to connect them through the lens of “behavior policy vs. reference policy,” as a complementary way to look at the problem.

Throughout the post I’ll use:

- **Behavior policy** $\mu$: the policy that *actually* generates rollouts, i.e., “under which distribution your data are sampled.” In modern LLM-RL systems this typically corresponds to the implementation inside the inference engine (vLLM, SGLang, etc.), and under asynchronous frameworks it is often a **mixture distribution over multiple worker policies**.

- **Reference policy** $\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}$: the policy used in the training objective for importance sampling, clipping, or KL constraints — typically the “old policy” in PPO / GRPO.

- **Target policy** $\pi_\theta$: the policy we optimize in the training objective, i.e., “what we want the model to become” — typically the “new policy” in PPO / GRPO.

In the classical idealized setup, we usually **implicitly assume** $\mu = \pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}$. In real systems, however, asynchronous updates, different inference / training backends, MoE routing fluctuations, and even hardware-level numerical differences cause these two policies to deviate to varying degrees.

## Related Work

Below is a rough timeline of the works that left a strong impression on me (this is only a partial and biased subset of the literature I’ve seen):

- [Decoupled PPO](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.00641) was among the first to point out that in trust-region policy optimization methods (TRPO and PPO), the “old policy” actually plays two distinct roles:

  1. It is used for importance sampling to perform off-policy correction. In this sense, the “old policy” is meant to represent the **behavior policy** that generated the training data.

  2. It is also used to limit the update step size of the new policy. In this sense, the “old policy” acts as a baseline to measure how much the new and old policies differ, i.e., a **proximal policy** (what I call the reference policy here).

  The paper points out that these two roles do *not* have to be played by the same policy, and proposes the Decoupled PPO objective, which explicitly decouples “who generates the data” from “who defines the trust region” at the level of the optimization objective.

- [AReaL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24298) focuses on the mismatch between behavior and reference policies under asynchronous training frameworks: rollouts are often generated by **stale parameter versions** or **different workers**. The paper adopts a Decoupled-PPO-style objective in the asynchronous setting, explicitly separating the behavior distribution from the reference policy, while still maintaining PPO-like optimization properties in this asynchronous regime.

- [GSPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18071) starts from stability issues of GRPO on long sequences and MoE models. It shows that token-level PPO / GRPO can become highly unstable when MoE expert routing is extremely volatile (especially when routing differs significantly between old and new policies), leading to huge variance and collapse. GSPO proposes a **sequence-level** PPO-style objective and ratio constraint, using the ratio over entire sequences to control updates. This substantially mitigates training collapse in MoE scenarios caused by routing instability and long-horizon token-level noise.

- [Your Efficient RL Framework Secretly Brings You Off-Policy RL Training](https://fengyao.notion.site/off-policy-rl#28b721e3f6c480c3a756f8fb319e860d) observes that in existing LLM-RL frameworks (such as VeRL), the inference stack and the training stack often differ across multiple functional modules (e.g., vLLM vs. FSDP / Megatron kernels and operators). This makes the behavior policy $\mu$ differ from the reference policy $\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}$, so what is *assumed* to be on-policy training actually becomes off-policy training with nontrivial bias. The article summarizes two existing ways to handle this: PPO-IS and vanilla-IS, and further proposes **token-level truncated importance sampling (TIS)** to downweight samples with severe training–inference mismatch. The author also wrote two more foundational notes analyzing training–inference mismatch from basic principles: [Part I](https://fengyao.notion.site/pg-seq-token-part1-basics) and [Part II](https://fengyao.notion.site/pg-seq-token-part2-mismatch).

- [Defeating Nondeterminism in LLM Inference](https://thinkingmachines.ai/blog/defeating-nondeterminism-in-llm-inference) points out that the lack of **batch-size invariance** is a core source of randomness in LLM inference: the same input can yield noticeably different probability distributions under different batch compositions and kernel paths. This means that even when you “nominally” have a single set of parameters, the **behavior policy** $\mu$ realized in practice can fluctuate with system load and scheduling, further exacerbating training–inference mismatch.

- [Small Leak Can Sink a Great Ship—Boost RL Training on MoE with 𝑰𝒄𝒆𝑷𝒐𝒑!](https://ringtech.notion.site/icepop) observes that the above mismatch issues are further amplified in MoE models: routing itself is highly sensitive to small perturbations, and stacked with inference / training implementation differences and asynchronous sampling, it is easy to magnify bias and instability. The paper proposes IcePop: at the **token level**, it computes importance sampling ratios and applies **two-sided masking** to discard tokens whose ratios are either too large or too small. This removes “very noisy” data from the gradient, stabilizing RL training on MoE models.

- [When Speed Kills Stability: Demystifying RL Collapse from the Training-Inference Mismatch](https://yingru.notion.site/When-Speed-Kills-Stability-Demystifying-RL-Collapse-from-the-Training-Inference-Mismatch-271211a558b7808d8b12d403fd15edda) gives a systematic analysis of the causes of training–inference mismatch, including large amounts of out-of-distribution and low-probability content introduced by agent workflows, hardware and kernel-level numerical uncertainty, and how **token-level** importance sampling can introduce severe bias on long sequences. It further proposes **sequence-level** masked importance sampling (sequence-level MIS): compute an IS ratio at the sequence level and discard only those sequences whose overall ratio is too large, thereby controlling bias while strongly suppressing training collapse caused by extreme samples. The paper provides reasonably complete theoretical derivations and extensive experimental evidence.

- [RL老训崩？训推差异是基石](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/1959976628290590602) approaches the problem more from a practical perspective, sharing experience on how to engineer for near training–inference consistency: choosing consistent operators and precision settings, monitoring and constraining the log-prob gap between training and inference, etc. The focus is on framework-level engineering practices that can mitigate training–inference difference at the root.

## A Minimally Unified View from a Three-Policy TRPO Perspective

At first glance, the works listed above seem to tackle different aspects:

- **Algorithmic level**: how to formulate PPO / GRPO objectives, token-level vs. sequence-level, clip vs. mask, etc.
- **Systems level**: how to align inference and training stacks.
- **Model level**: how MoE routing amplifies instability, and so on.

However, if we align everything along a single axis — **behavior policy vs. reference policy** — a large fraction of these issues can be placed in a relatively simple theoretical framework: a **three-policy TRPO**.

In the next section I’ll unpack this three-policy TRPO in as simple math as I can. You can think of it as “TRPO + triangle inequality” — a very small extension conceptually, but surprisingly handy when analyzing training–inference mismatch in LLM-RL:

- On the one hand, it helps us understand what exactly “training–inference mismatch” and “asynchronous training frameworks” are harming within the TRPO view.
- On the other hand, it offers a unifying way to interpret TIS, IcePop, sequence-level MIS, etc. In the view of this post, they can all be seen as different incarnations of **Constraint 2** introduced below.

### Three Policies

We stick to the notation from above and consider a discounted MDP with discount factor $\gamma \in (0,1)$:

- States $s \in \mathcal{S}$, actions $a \in \mathcal{A}$.
- Policy $\pi(a \mid s)$.
- Discounted state distribution:
  $$
  d_\pi(s) := (1-\gamma)\sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t \Pr_\pi(s_t = s).
  $$
- Return (episodic view):
  $$
  \mathcal{J}(\pi) := \mathbb{E}_\pi\Big[\sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t r_t\Big].
  $$
- Value / Q / advantage functions:
  $$
  V_\pi(s),\quad Q_\pi(s,a),\quad A_\pi(s,a) := Q_\pi(s,a) - V_\pi(s).
  $$

It’s worth spelling out that in the three-policy setup we have:

- **Behavior policy** $\mu$: the policy that actually generates rollouts. Data $(s,a,r,\dots)$ are sampled from it.

- **Reference policy** $\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}$: the “old policy” used in the optimization objective for importance sampling ratios, clipping, or KL constraints.

- **Target policy** $\pi_\theta$: the policy we are optimizing in this update.

In the ideal setup we assume $\mu = \pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}$; in real systems they are often unequal. This is the mathematical shadow of “training–inference mismatch.”

### Two-Policy TRPO

> If you’re already familiar with TRPO, feel free to skip ahead to the “Three-Policy TRPO” subsection.

All the theoretical guarantees in TRPO are stated **with respect to the advantage function of some baseline policy**. Since the only advantage we can estimate reliably in practice is $A_\mu$ (data are sampled under $\mu$), we may as well treat $\mu$ as the baseline policy.

A classical result is the **Performance Difference Lemma**:

> For any two policies $\mu$ and $\pi_\theta$, we have
> $$
> \mathcal{J}(\pi_\theta) - \mathcal{J}(\mu)
> = \frac{1}{1-\gamma}\;
> \mathbb{E}_{s\sim d_{\pi_\theta},\, a\sim\pi_\theta}[A_\mu(s,a)].
> $$

The intuition is simple:

- $A_\mu(s,a)$ says: “if I deviate from what $\mu$ would do at state $s$ and instead take action $a$, how much will the long-term return change?”
- Summing that “gain” across all time steps, states, and actions gives the total improvement of the new policy over the behavior policy.

The challenge in TRPO is that we cannot compute
$$
\mathbb{E}_{s\sim d_{\pi_\theta}, a\sim\pi_\theta}[A_\mu(s,a)]
$$
exactly, because $d_{\pi_\theta}$ is the state distribution of the *new* policy, under which we do not have samples.

So TRPO introduces a surrogate objective by replacing the state distribution with that of the behavior policy:

$$
L_\mu(\pi_\theta)
:= \mathcal{J}(\mu) + \frac{1}{1-\gamma}\mathbb{E}_{s\sim d_\mu,\,a\sim \pi_\theta}[A_\mu(s,a)].
$$

Intuitively, $L_\mu$ asks the following question: “Under the states visited by the behavior policy, how good is the new policy if we just let it pick the actions?”

Starting from the Performance Difference Lemma, the difference between the true objective and the surrogate is:

$$
\mathcal{J}(\pi_\theta) - L_\mu(\pi_\theta)
= \frac{1}{1-\gamma}\;
  \sum_s \big(d_{\pi_\theta}(s) - d_\mu(s)\big)
  \,\mathbb{E}_{a\sim\pi_\theta(\cdot\mid s)}[A_\mu(s,a)].
$$

If we define

$$
\epsilon_\mu := \max_{s,a} |A_\mu(s,a)|,
$$

we immediately get the following upper bound:

> **Lemma 1**  
> $$
> |\mathcal{J}(\pi_\theta) - L_\mu(\pi_\theta)|
> \le \frac{\epsilon_\mu}{1-\gamma}\;
>     \|d_{\pi_\theta} - d_\mu\|_1.
> $$

This reveals the first key quantity:

> **State distribution shift** $\|d_{\pi_\theta} - d_\mu\|_1$, i.e., “how differently the new policy sees the world, compared to the behavior policy.”

We usually do *not* directly impose constraints on $\|d_{\pi_\theta} - d_\mu\|_1$. Instead, we constrain the per-timestep action distribution difference — via trust regions, KL penalties, clipping, etc.

Define the total variation (TV) distance:
$$
D_{\mathrm{TV}}(p,q) := \frac{1}{2}\|p-q\|_1.
$$

Assume there is a constant $\beta$ such that

> For all $s$, the TV distance between the behavior and target policies is bounded:
> $$
> D_{\mathrm{TV}}\big(\mu(\cdot\mid s), \pi_\theta(\cdot\mid s)\big) \le \beta.
> $$

Intuitively: in any state, the action distribution of the “new policy” cannot deviate too much from that of the policy that generated the data.

A standard result (provable via coupling) is:

> **Lemma 2**  
> Under the assumption above,
> $$
> \|d_{\pi_\theta} - d_\mu\|_1
> \le \frac{2\gamma}{1-\gamma}\,\beta.
> $$

Combining Lemma 1 and Lemma 2, we obtain

$$
|\mathcal{J}(\pi_\theta) - L_\mu(\pi_\theta)|
\le \frac{\epsilon_\mu}{1-\gamma}\; \frac{2\gamma}{1-\gamma}\,\beta
= \frac{2\epsilon_\mu\gamma}{(1-\gamma)^2}\,\beta.
$$

This gives a remarkably compact **two-policy TRPO lower bound (baseline = behavior policy)**:

> **Theorem 1 (Two-Policy TRPO)**  
> $$
> \mathcal{J}(\pi_\theta)
> \;\ge\;
> L_\mu(\pi_\theta)
> \;-\;
> \frac{2\epsilon_\mu\gamma}{(1-\gamma)^2}\,\beta.
> $$

This tells us:

- **What really matters for the tightness of $L_\mu(\pi_\theta)$ as a surrogate for $\mathcal{J}(\pi_\theta)$ is how far the behavior policy $\mu$ and the target policy $\pi_\theta$ drift apart:**
  $$
  \beta = \max_s D_{\mathrm{TV}}\big(\mu(\cdot\mid s), \pi_\theta(\cdot\mid s)\big).
  $$

If you can directly control this $\beta$, you can essentially port TRPO’s monotonic improvement guarantees to the behavior-policy view.

### Three-Policy TRPO

In practice, especially in large-scale LLM-RL, **we often cannot directly control $\beta$ itself.**

In most PPO / GRPO / GSPO / RLHF-style frameworks, the actual situation is:

- Rollout data are generated by some **behavior policy** $\mu$ (some particular parameter version plus system details inside the inference engine).
- During updates, we would like to leverage a **reference policy** $\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}$ to limit the update of the **target policy** $\pi_\theta$.

In other words, what we can actually touch and control are two quantities:

1. **Reference vs. target**: via KL penalties, clipping, etc., we constrain
   $$
   D_{\mathrm{TV}}\big(\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}(\cdot\mid s),\pi_\theta(\cdot\mid s)\big).
   $$

2. **Behavior vs. reference**: we would *like* to keep
   $$
   D_{\mathrm{TV}}\big(\mu(\cdot\mid s),\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}(\cdot\mid s)\big)
   $$
   small as well — this is where training–inference mismatch and asynchronous execution come in.

This motivates defining two “proxy gaps”:

- **Constraint 1: reference vs. target**
  $$
  \alpha_0
  := \max_s D_{\mathrm{TV}}\big(\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}(\cdot\mid s),
                                \pi_\theta(\cdot\mid s)\big);
  $$

- **Constraint 2: behavior vs. reference**
  $$
  \alpha_1
  := \max_s D_{\mathrm{TV}}\big(\mu(\cdot\mid s),
                                \pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}(\cdot\mid s)\big).
  $$

Intuitively:

- $\alpha_0$: how far the new policy is from the “old policy” you are using in the loss — this is the trust region part.
- $\alpha_1$: how far the reference policy used in training is from the *actual* behavior policy that generated the data — this is the footprint of training–inference mismatch and asynchrony.

Now we can plug these two quantities back into the TRPO lower bound.

For any state $s$, by the triangle inequality we have
$$
\begin{aligned}
D_{\mathrm{TV}}\big(\mu(\cdot\mid s),\pi_\theta(\cdot\mid s)\big)
&\le
D_{\mathrm{TV}}\big(\mu(\cdot\mid s),\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}(\cdot\mid s)\big)
\\
&\quad +
D_{\mathrm{TV}}\big(\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}(\cdot\mid s),\pi_\theta(\cdot\mid s)\big).
\end{aligned}
$$

Taking the supremum over $s$ gives

$$
\beta
:= \max_s D_{\mathrm{TV}}\big(\mu(\cdot\mid s),\pi_\theta(\cdot\mid s)\big)
\;\le\;
\alpha_1 + \alpha_0.
$$

Plugging this inequality into the two-policy TRPO bound (Theorem 1), and denoting

$$
C := \frac{2\epsilon_\mu\gamma}{(1-\gamma)^2},
$$

we obtain
$$
\mathcal{J}(\pi_\theta)
\;\ge\;
L_\mu(\pi_\theta)
\;-\;
C\,\beta
\;\ge\;
L_\mu(\pi_\theta)
\;-\;
C\,(\alpha_0 + \alpha_1).
$$

This yields a very direct **three-policy TRPO lower bound**:

> $$

The meaning of this bound is quite straightforward:

- **The gap between the surrogate objective $L_\mu(\pi_\theta)$ and the true performance $\mathcal{J}(\pi_\theta)$ decomposes into two pieces:**
  - The deviation between reference and target policies, $\alpha_0$.
  - The deviation between behavior and reference policies, $\alpha_1$.

As long as both terms are small, **optimizing $L_\mu$ is likely to improve $\mathcal{J}$**.

### How to Control These Two Deviations in Practice?

We can now revisit various practical methods through the lens of Theorem 2:

- Most PPO / GRPO / GSPO-style work focuses on controlling **Constraint 1: $\alpha_0$**.
- Most TIS / IcePop / MIS-style work, in the view of this post, can be understood as primarily targeting **Constraint 2: $\alpha_1$**.

In the remainder of this post I will focus on **Constraint 2**.

The goal of Constraint 2 is: **ensure that the data used in training come (effectively) from a behavior policy that is close to the reference policy.**

In practice, this usually involves both **system-level mechanisms** and **algorithmic mechanisms (importance sampling)**.

1. **System level: keep the behavior policy from drifting too far**

   - Asynchronous frameworks:  
     Tag each sample with a policy version, and only use data generated by parameter versions that are close enough to $\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}$.

   - Training–inference alignment:  
     Use consistent precision, operators, and similar kernel behavior between the training and inference stacks.

   These mechanisms act “outside” the algorithm to make $\mu$ closer to $\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}$, thereby shrinking $\alpha_1$.

2. **Algorithmic level: sample-wise correction**

   At the algorithmic level, we no longer attempt to “fix” the entire behavior policy. Instead, we use importance sampling ratios to correct at the **sample level**: we filter or reweight samples so that the behavior policy is close to the reference policy *on the subset of data that actually participates in training*, or at least reduce the influence of samples with large mismatch.

   Concretely, this gives rise to methods like TIS, IcePop, and MIS, which can be seen as different ways of implementing Constraint 2 at the sample level.

## TIS, IcePop, and Sequence-Level MIS: Different Implementations of Constraint 2

In this section I’ll reuse the notation introduced above to write down the objectives of these three methods, focusing only on the design choices related to “behavior vs. reference policy.” Let the token-level PPO / GRPO-style update term be

$$
g_\theta(t)
= \min\big(r_t(\theta) A_t,\ \text{clip}(r_t(\theta),1-\epsilon,1+\epsilon) A_t\big),
$$

where

$$
r_t(\theta) = \frac{\pi_\theta(a_t\mid s_t)}{\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}(a_t\mid s_t)},
\quad (s_t,a_t)\sim\mu,\quad A_t := A_\mu(s_t,a_t).
$$

Here:

- $r_t(\theta)$ is the **target vs. reference** ratio (corresponding to Constraint 1).
- $A_t$ is the advantage estimated from data sampled under the behavior policy.

To connect token-level $(s_t,a_t)$ with sequence-level $(x,y)$ notation, consider the RLHF setting (reinforcement learning from human feedback) for LLMs:

- Prompts are denoted by $x$, and responses by $y = (y_1,\dots,y_{|y|})$.
- Token-level states and actions are defined as $s_t := (x,y_{<t})$, $a_t := y_t$.
- The behavior and reference policies on sequences can then be written as
  $$
  \mu(y\mid x) = \prod_{t=1}^{|y|}\mu(a_t=y_t\mid s_t),\quad
  \pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}(y\mid x) = \prod_{t=1}^{|y|}\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}(a_t=y_t\mid s_t).
  $$

To quantify the deviation between reference and behavior policies, we can define the token-level importance ratio:

$$
\rho_t^{(\text{ref}\leftarrow\text{beh})} := 
\frac{\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}(a_t\mid s_t)}{\mu(a_t\mid s_t)},
$$

and its sequence-level counterpart:

$$
\rho(y\mid x) := \frac{\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}(y\mid x)}{\mu(y\mid x)} 
= \prod_{t=1}^{|y|} \rho_t^{(\text{ref}\leftarrow\text{beh})}.
$$

The difference between TIS, IcePop, and MIS lies in **how they use $\rho$ to implement Constraint 2**.

### 1. TIS: Token-Level Truncated Importance Sampling

TIS directly truncates the token-level ratio $\rho_t^{(\text{ref}\leftarrow\text{beh})}$; define

$$
\color{blue}{w_t = \min\big(\rho_t^{(\text{ref}\leftarrow\text{beh})},\ C_{\text{IS}}\big)}.
$$

The update objective becomes

$$
L_{\text{TIS}}(\theta) 
= - \mathbb{E}_{(s_t,a_t)\sim\mu}\big[\,\color{blue}{w_t}\; g_\theta(t)\big].
$$

- The blue $\color{blue}{w_t}$ is the truncated IS weight: extremely large ratios are capped at a constant $C_{\text{IS}}$.
- From the three-policy TRPO perspective, this is a *soft* way to downweight tokens where behavior and reference policies differ significantly, effectively reducing their contribution to $\alpha_1$ in the gradient.

---

### 2. IcePop: Token-Level Two-Sided Masking in MoE

IcePop also uses $\rho_t^{(\text{ref}\leftarrow\text{beh})}$ as a discrepancy measure, but opts for **two-sided masking**:

$$
\color{blue}{m_t = \mathbf{1}\big[C_{\text{low}} \le \rho_t^{(\text{ref}\leftarrow\text{beh})} \le C_{\text{high}}\big]}.
$$

The update objective becomes

$$
L_{\text{IcePop}}(\theta) 
= - \mathbb{E}_{(s_t,a_t)\sim\mu}\big[\,\color{blue}{m_t}\; g_\theta(t)\big].
$$

- The blue $\color{blue}{m_t}$ decides whether a token participates in the update: tokens with ratios that are too large or too small are dropped entirely.
- This is a *hard* sample selection scheme: only tokens where behavior and reference policies are reasonably aligned (ratios within $[C_{\text{low}}, C_{\text{high}}]$) are kept, implementing a stricter version of Constraint 2 at the token level.

---

### 3. Sequence-Level MIS: Masked Importance Sampling Over Entire Sequences

The core operation in MIS is to **retain only sequences whose sequence-level IS ratio is below a threshold $C$**, zeroing out the loss for all other sequences:

$$
\color{blue}{
\rho(y\mid x)
\leftarrow
\rho(y\mid x)\,\mathbf{1}\{\rho(y\mid x)\le C\}
}
$$

In a unified loss form, this can be written as

$$
L_{\text{MIS}}(\theta)
=-\,\mathbb{E}_{(x,y)\sim\mu}
\Big[
\color{blue}{\rho(y\mid x)\,\mathbf{1}\{\rho(y\mid x)\le C\}} 
\;\cdot\; \sum_{t=1}^{|y|}g_\theta(t)
\Big].
$$

In words:

- For **sequences with small IS ratios**, the full weight $\rho(y\mid x)$ is retained for off-policy correction.
- For **sequences whose ratios exceed the threshold $C$**, the entire policy loss is masked out (weight set to $0$).

From the three-policy TRPO viewpoint, MIS no longer truncates at the token level. Instead, it performs **trajectory-level** filtering: it drops trajectories where behavior and reference policies diverge too much, and only optimizes on the subset with $\rho(y\mid x)\le C$. This implements Constraint 2 at the sequence level.

## Conclusion

If I had to compress this post into a single sentence, it would be:

> **Many issues around “training–inference mismatch” and “asynchronous training” in large-scale LLM RL can be understood, in the TRPO framework, as severely underestimating the deviation between the behavior policy $\mu$ and the reference policy $\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}$ — i.e., the term $\alpha_1$.**

From two policies to three, what we did is conceptually very small:

- We rewrote the TRPO lower bound from a “old vs. new policy” narrative into a “**behavior–reference–target**” three-policy relationship.

- We explicitly separated two TV distances:
  - **Constraint 1: reference vs. target**, $\alpha_0$, corresponding to the KL / clip / trust-region style constraints in PPO / GRPO / GSPO.
  - **Constraint 2: behavior vs. reference**, $\alpha_1$, capturing real-world factors like asynchronous frameworks, training–inference mismatch, MoE routing volatility, kernel-level nondeterminism, etc.

- This leads to a very simple conclusion:  
  The gap between the surrogate $L_\mu(\pi_\theta)$ and the true performance $\mathcal{J}(\pi_\theta)$ scales with $\alpha_0 + \alpha_1$.

Under this lens (which is of course only one of many possible perspectives):

- Decoupled PPO / AReaL can be viewed as **formally acknowledging the existence of three policies** and explicitly decoupling the behavior distribution from the reference policy in the objective.

- TIS, IcePop, and sequence-level MIS can be seen as different ways of implementing **Constraint 2** at different granularities (token vs. sequence) using importance sampling truncation / masking:
  - TIS: token-level truncation of IS weights to soften the influence of extreme samples.
  - IcePop: token-level two-sided masking in MoE to hard-drop tokens with severe mismatch.
  - MIS: sequence-level masking to ignore entire trajectories whose behavior–reference mismatch is too large.

- Engineering advice such as in *RL老训崩？训推差异是基石* and system-level work like *Defeating Nondeterminism in LLM Inference* can be interpreted as efforts to **reduce $\alpha_1$ on the systems and numerical side**, so that the assumptions underlying the algorithms do not break too badly.

From this unified perspective, it may also be easier to think about the following practical questions (these are completely open and I don’t have definitive answers):

- Under what conditions can we still reasonably interpret “LLM RL training” as some approximate form of TRPO / PPO?

- For a concrete RL system, where should we invest more effort:
  - tightening $\alpha_0$ (stronger KL control, more stable sequence-level objectives), or
  - reducing $\alpha_1$ (better training–inference alignment, more aggressive MIS / TIS / IcePop)?

- In the presence of MoE, asynchronous sampling, and complex agent workflows, how long can we safely pretend that “$\mu \approx \pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}$”?

This post is just a very **minimal** extension of the classic TRPO framework, making the “three policies” explicit and using them to organize some existing work. There are inevitably misunderstandings and omissions. If you also care about how RL training actually behaves in large LLM systems, I’d be very interested to see how your own setup can be abstracted into a relationship between $\mu$, $\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}$, and $\pi_\theta$, and then re-examined through the inequality in Theorem 2. It might give a slightly different intuitive feel for what your system is really optimizing.
